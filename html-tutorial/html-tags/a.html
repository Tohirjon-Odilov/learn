        <p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever
                since.</p>
        <p>"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't
                had the advantages that you've had."</p>
        <p>He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
                meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has
                opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind
                is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about
                that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,
                unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought-frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile
                levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for
                the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually
                plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a
                little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat,
                a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.</p>
        <p>And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on
                the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back
                from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention
                forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man
                who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction-Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have
                an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something
                gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those
                intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with
                that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the "creative temperament"-it was an
                extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is
                not likely I shall ever find again. No-Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what
                foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and
                short-winded elations of men.</p>
